# Hello!

# About The Website

This is my personal online profile, an alternative to social media accounts that i dont really like using.
I'm posting here some of my work related projects and other free time projects.

Think of this as my blog archive of random projects.

# About Me

My name is Bartek and I love to make stuff. 

( Althought maybe im bad at finishing them. )

I'm a game and VR training applications developer. 
I'm especially passionate about creating games and apps that people genuinely use and connect with.

Most of my virtual work is coded in c# language. I primary use the Unity Engine for commercial work and monogame for my own games.
