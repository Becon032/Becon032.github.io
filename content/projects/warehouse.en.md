# About

This VR application, created for logistics students, offers an interactive way to learn hall planning and equipment management. I developed a system where users can select objects from a menu and place them within a hall model. The app tracks not only the cost of equipment but also the total expenses involved in furnishing the entire hall, based on an editable cost table that teachers can adjust. Users can also teleport into the hall model to explore it in a 1:1 scale, giving them a realistic, first-person perspective. Additional features include tools for editing hall equipment, a mode where users can identify mistakes in pre-built examples, and a mode focused on teaching the process of designing a production hall. This project provides a hands-on, practical approach to learning logistics and facility planning.
