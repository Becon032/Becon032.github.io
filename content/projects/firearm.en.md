# About

Developed for Moratex, the Polish Institute of Security Technology, as part of a larger project that combines real-world tasks with an immersive VR experience. I was responsible for creating accurate weapon mechanics, including detailed assembly and disassembly processes, realistic handling, reloading systems, and simulating the state of every bullet in the magazine and chamber. The simulator features natural hand poses to replicate real-world interactions and supports VR treadmill integration, allowing users to physically move within the virtual environment. Designed to assist with internal ergonomic testing, the app provides a safe, interactive environment for users to practice and enhance their skills and efficiency.
