# About

This project involved developing a traffic management training app for police officers, created for the Polish Institute of Security Technology Moratex. The app was designed to help officers refresh their skills and reduce stress during traffic control situations, especially when they haven’t had to handle them in a while. I developed interactive scenarios that mimic real-world traffic situations, giving users a chance to quickly go over key procedures. The app includes dynamic traffic that responds to user gestures and input, making it feel more realistic. I also integrated hand tracking gloves, which made interactions more intuitive and allowed for precise tracking of every hand and finger gesture. The simulation includes preset difficult situations, like emergencies, that unfold naturally during use. The app provides real-time feedback, helping officers regain confidence and handle traffic flow more effectively.
