# About

This project focused on developing a training application to teach tanker operation procedures for Linde employees. I was responsible for designing and implementing all interactive elements within the environment, along with an editable step-by-step list that directs users through each task. These procedures account for the interaction with tanker components and objects necessary to perform industry-standard operations. The application also creates customizable scenarios that simulate real-world processes, such as monitoring liquid levels, temperature, and pressure. It responds to user actions in a way that mirrors real-life conditions, providing an immersive and practical learning experience.
